  It is **TBD** whether we will run these notebooks using [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/), a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), or the [Ohio Supercomputer Center](https://www.osc.edu/).

Lecture attendance
: You are allowed 5**** absences (out of 41**** classes) without penalty; these include university excused absences for illness, death in the immediate family, religious observance, jury duty, or involvement in University-sponsored activities. Each additional absence will reduce your final average by 0.5%. Your attendance record will be available in Blackboard.

Homework

Labs
: In **10**? of the weeks, the Tuesday lab meeting will be used for (computer) laboratories, to be completed during that time. Missed labs cannot be made up, but your lowest score is dropped.

Projects
: There are three substantial, multi-week projects during the semester. Some time in the Tuesday lab meetings will be used to work on projects. You can do your project alone or with one partner. 
           
Tests and Exam

Grade
: Your grade is based on the labs 10%, the homework 20%, the projects 25%, the midterm test 15%, and the final exam 30%.
  An average of 90% guarantees you at least an A-, 80% a B-, 70% a C-, and 60% a D-.

	* Explanations by other students in this class.
	* Explanations by friends, roommates etc.
	    
	Acknowledge and describe this help in writing on the
	problem where it was used. For example, you might write
